OpenGL assignment 3

This assignment is kind of easy, but there are still some points need to be paid attention to: 

1, the center of the object v.s. the origin of the NDC space v.s. the center of the screen
  Because these three concepts are not the same one, the problem could result in: 
  1) the rotation speed of the cube varies according to which side faces us and which direction are we trying to rotate it; 
  2) when click and move from the corner, usually the rotation angle is not satisfactory, especially for the armadillo, which is rotating in the opposite direction.
